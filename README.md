### Features List
- Google books API- using the Google books API to fetch a list of books which match
the search term. We used debounce to minimize API calls.
When adding a book from the Google books API, we use a function that converts the
argument passed to it, from the Google books API format to the format we have
used in our database, and adds it to the applicationâ€™s book database in local
storage. 
- Reviews- the user can add a review on each book.
-  User messages using the event bus
- Routing
